Gettings started with the LabVIEW-Etherbone interface
=====================================================

- from a console, do "eb-snoop 5555 0x10000-0x20000"
  (you need to install Etherbone first)
- use LabVIEW and have a look at the "lvEtherbone.lvlib"
- open the VI-Tree "lvEtherbone.VI-Tree.vi"
- open and start "application_example" 
  (by specifying the IP "localhost" and port number 5555)
